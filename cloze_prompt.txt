Given a Japanese word or phrase, you need provide JSON-formatted flashcards with example sentences for that word.

The flashcards should use Anki's cloze completion syntax.
If the word is a verb, the example sentences may use a different conjugation than the one provided.
Try to cover all common usages of the word or phrase with your example sentences.
The flashcards should contain the following information:

- Word: The word or phrase itself.
- Example Sentence: An example sentence that uses the word in context. Replace the word itself with Anki cloze syntax, including the hiragana reading of the word.
- English: The English translation of the sentence.


Examples of the JSON format for single flashcards:

'''
{
  "word": "芳醇"
  "example_sentence": "これは{{c1::芳醇::ほうじゅん}}な赤ワインだ。"
  "english": "This is a full-bodied red wine.",

  "word": "河川敷"
